// MYSQL SERVER HOST NAME
// This is the name of the host machine that the MySQL server 
// is installed on. In many cases it is the same as the web 
// server so "localhost" will suffice. If this is incorrect you
// will need to speak with a server administrator to obtain the
// host name.
// If you leave the variable empty it will default to "localhost"

// DATABASE NAME (REQUIRED)
// This is the name of the database that you wish to use, which
// you may have either already set up in MySQL, or had one
// assigned to you. The Address Book will be unable to create
// a database if one does not already exist, so make sure you
// have one.

// This is the user name that you use to log in to MySQL.

// Passwords may be left blank if you do not have one.

// DATABASE TABLE PREFIX
// A database can contain a large number of tables, some of 
// which may be used for other applications than the Address
// Book. If you have only one database to work with you may 
// wish to provide a prefix which would make it easier to find
// and identify tables related to the Address Book. We suggest
// using the prefix "address_" but you may also choose not to
// use a prefix by leaving the variable blank.
// Do NOT use the - (dash) character, or spaces or / (slash)

// TURN OFF LOGIN
// This feature has been removed from config.php and can now
// be set through the script in the options control panel.
